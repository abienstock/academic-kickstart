I am a first year PhD student working with [Yevgeniy Dodis](https://cs.nyu.edu/~dodis/index.html) in the [Cryptography Lab](https://cs.nyu.edu/crg/cryptography/) at NYU. We work on projects related to Secure Group Messaging.

I am generally interested in Cryptography, Computational Complexity, Algorithms, and Theoretical Computer Science, as a whole.

I previously obtained a BS in Computer Science from Columbia University, where I worked with [Allison Bishop](https://www.thecomputersciencecomedian.com/). We worked on projects related to Lattice-Based Cryptography.
